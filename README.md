A little about myself .. I am a soon to be retired Carpenter .. I've spent the last 30 years building stuff for people to live work and play in and around .. but my body is beat up and run down ./.. but supprisingly .. my mind is sharper than ever ..\.  (might have something to do with  .. not smoking pot anymore ..,."OKAY OKAY" yea it causes short term memory loss .. lol .. finally old enough to admit that lol ... anyways .. back to the subject at hand ...
Retirement .. hmmm not retirement (REBIRTH)  yea thats it
I'm 53 and plan to build stuff for people to live work and play in and around .. for the next 30 years ...
but instead of usuing nails and wood ... ill be using bits and bytes .. 
so join me as i start my next half of life ,,, and teach myself coding .. just like i taught myself how to build a ladder to the moon '30 yeasrs ago.. (just never found anyone who could provide the materials or pay for the labor) ...
